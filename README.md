# Project-Free-Shirts
My moderately successful attempt at getting free shirts from colleges (a lot of them) just by asking. Instead of manually looking up their address, and sending individual emails, I decided to automate it. Since the macro button doesn't seem to be showing in the excel file, I have also added a file for the macro.
